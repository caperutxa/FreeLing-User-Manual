# Execute FreeLing on Windows

FreeLing provides a main program that allows to execute most of its capabilities.  
However, remember that FreeLing is a library and that much more functionalities are accessible writting your own main program.

The provided main program can be executed running the command:

```
   FREELINGDIR\freeling\bin\analyze.bat -f en.cfg < myfile.txt
```

Where the folder `FREELINGDIR` is:

* If you installed a Windows binary package, `FREELINGDIR` is the folder where you uncompressed it\)
* If you installed on Windows compiling from source, `FREELINGDIR` is the folder you used as `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.  If you used the default installation, it is `C:\Program Files`.

The script `analyze.bat` behaves just the Linux `analyze` script. Check FreeLing manual \([https://talp-upc.gitbooks.io/freeling-user-manual/](https://talp-upc.gitbooks.io/freeling-user-manual/)\), section "Using the analyze script", to find out the parameters it accepts.

Note that the input text in `myfile.txt` must be UTF8 encoded. You can also provide input from the terminal and end it with ctl-Z.   
Take into account windows command prompt is not UTF8, so you will find problems if you use non-ascii characters.

See sections [Execute FreeLing demo](../analyzer.md) and [Call FreeLing Library](../user-application.md) to find out more on how to use FreeLing.   


## Build your C++ program to call FreeLing

If you want to call freeling from your own C++ program, you can compile it with MSVC, and link it with FreeLing library. 

You can get started with some of the examples in the tutorial.

However, note that you will need to compile your program with the following  definitions: 
```
_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS=1
_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE=1
NOMINMAX
NDEBUG=1
WIN32=1
_CONSOLE=1
```
